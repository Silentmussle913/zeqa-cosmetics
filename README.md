# zeqa-cosmetics

## this is an upcoming mod that has all of zeqas cosmetics till like april 1st 2025 (i dont like any new ones so im not updating the cosmetics part) a guy setup multiple bots in the servers using bionic bens mod smt smt that he modfied to copy the 3d cosmetics and output them in obj format into a private data server that was all converted into a fdx format 3d design and also uses ai to remove the skin (its been hella buggy but works) and the filtered result is going into a external computer running in my attic that has blender and bb and converts them into bedrock geometry format (geo.json) and a external mod has been created with another private server that has a custom database and a small mod that can be installed in any server to allow zeqa cosmetics this mod can be tethered to the official zeqa db like silentmussle913 has 3 antlers or smt but its runnign on a custom db so no one has anything atm and cross-world tradings is also supported and completed. capes artifacts and custom ranks everything from zeqa is supported in ur private worlds now. This was planned a long time ago but no one could figure this shit out so it took a while.. but now its developing encryptions to protect against people accessing the private db to give themselves shit after this it would prob be out. it was planned to have a switch that can let u switch between the private db and zeqa's official db but i started hating zeqa so idk. and quick notice we might resort to having dll injection as idk how to encrypt a cosmetic but if i figure it out then no need for dll injection. and importantly no the 3d files are not going to be stored in the pack thats the main issue we also have a custom renderer for fdx ingame mcpe that is going into the play.. so a lot of stuff needs to be sorted out for this and there is like 4 servers runnign on this for like 6 months till now ðŸ˜­.

### Here is some pics of whats going on and how it will look ðŸ”¥
